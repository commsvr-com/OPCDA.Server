# OPCDA.Server

CommServer - redundant, multi-protocol, multi-channel opc server for large scale distributed systems software package. CommServer is a package of communication software to manage data transfer. Built-in technologies and algorithms provide a smart data transfer automatically adapting its parameters to the userâ€™s or process needs.

CommServer software provides:

- Integration of production supervision systems (MES, SCADA) with management systems of operations and supplies in an enterprise (ERP, SAP, CRM).
- Building of communication basing on a uniform standard.
- Optimization of communication infrastructure utilization of visualization and supervision systems, e.g.:
  - Reduction of GPRS broadcast costs by about 80%
  - Increase of radio communication systems performance by over 600%
- Considerably easier (cheaper) extension and connection of next objects.
- Increase of functionalities and efficiencies of the existing systems.
- Creation of OPC servers for non-standard (own) protocols.

As a result, it is possible to create one, open and universal, intelligently administered platform of data exchange in an enterprise, accessible to all systems, instead of creation of separate infrastructure for each individual system.

CommServer package contains:

- OPC Servers:
  - OPC Server for Excel
  - OPC Server for M-BUS
  - OPC Server for Modbus (IP)
  - OPC Server for Modbus (RS)
  - OPC Server for SAIA (IP)
  - OPC Server for SAIA (RS)
